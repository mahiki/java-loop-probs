public class BubbleSortInt<T>     right? implements Comparable<...>

             BubbleSort<T>()      {} do not instantiate
        void sortArray(T[] A)     sort generic array A[] in place

notes
this will receive a array of parametrized type and sort in place, destroys old array ordering. The sorting is a side effect, i don't think creating a duplicate array is the way to go.

Still don't think a constructor is needed.
